					<p>All in all, Isaac Newton developed and invented many things in his wonderful life.  He was a great scientist, mathematician, and astronomer.  Thanks to Newton, we know about gravity, motion, and colors.  Without Newton, who knows where science would be now.  He inspires everyone to discover new things and have fun doing it.  Isaac Newton will be remembered forever for his amazing discoveries and inventions.</p>
